Revision history for Data-Verifier

0.29    March 10, 2010
  * Add post_filter_value to Field and populate it with the value after
    applying filters.
  * Populate original_value with the value that was submitted, unchanged.
    This is a slightly invasive change but if the field was valid then it will
    re-filter back to the same value so it is considered safe to do.
  * Change type of original_value to ArrayRef|Str to handle multiple
    values of a param.

0.28    February 2, 2010
  * Document that type will allow a TypeConstraint instance and add a test
    so if we break it, we know.
  * Rename all the tests to not include a number, since the order is not
    relevant.

0.20
  * Improve Field POD

    the field.
  * Result's value is no longer serialized.
